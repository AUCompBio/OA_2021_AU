# A comparison of the benefits of open-access publishing across various sub-fields in Biology

As an extension of a class project, we investigated the benefits of open-access (OA) publishing across different hybrid access journals in Biology. We selected 152 journals across 12 sub-fields totalling nearly 150k articles. We download citation information directly from Web of Science and merged this with meta-data compiled on each targeted journal.

In this github repository is our raw data as well as all the code used to analyze the data. The project is organized into three main folders:

- Data
 - This folder contains the raw data and meta-data used to conduct our analysis. 
- Outputs
 - This folder contains the outputs of our analysis from the scripts used to conduct the analysis.
- Scripts
 - This folder contains the Rproject as well as the scripts used to combine the raw data into a format useful for analysis. We also include code for our statistical models as well as the figures and tables in the manuscript document.

By selecting hybrid journals, we were able to directly comapre the impact of paid OA (other Gold) under a model where the author pays an APC directly to the publisher and free OA (Green) where the author makes their work open access by depositing into an institutional repository or uploading a pre-print. We feel this novel approach to investigating the benefits of OA publishing yields important insights for Biologists regarding decisions in where they publish their work and how they choose to make it available to others.
