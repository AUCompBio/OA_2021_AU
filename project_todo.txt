_/ = completed
* = working idea
! = needs attention

#### General ####
 Update readme!DG/SB

#### Data Wrangling/Clean UP ####
Things to export from original dataframe to fin dataframe (with index):
 year [45], author [2], reprint_address[24] _/
 
 remove Nature ecology & evolution _/
 
Things to edit for fin dataframe:
 impact factor quantiles _/
 author count _/
 origin of publication (corresponding author) _/ LSS
  This is add- but there are still some issues, example: Lanka = Sri Lanka _/ LSS
 exclude data that is from Zebrafish & published in 2019 _/ 
 Identify journals missing years with entries in timeframe & those with name changes _/ TM
 GNI per country (classifying developing countries) 
 Matching GNI to authors LSS


Things to manually add to metadata:
 impact factor quantiles from WoS _PH
 impact factor _/ ACC/ZP
 grant/funding(research field ranking replaced this) _/ LSS
 journal country _/ SB
 publisher _/ ZP
 *Decide on minimum number of records per author country of origin
 
Filter by matching OA/CA in Volume_Issue _/ 
###### Statistical model notes #######
 add random variable of journal _/
 add nesting factor for journal in research field _/
 
perform ordinary least squares linear regression with log-transformed 'normcite' variable _/ TM

 get GLM models to converge _/
    center and scale variables
    increase number of iterations 
    AC/TM -- AC went to 400,000 iterations in Rstudio, TM went to 1Mil on HPC 
    -- Still no convergence. Concluded that model was too complex, TM concurred. 

 to include as fixed effects in model testing: 
  pub year _/, # of authors _/, field _/, JCR quartile _/, 
  publisher _/, APC _/, AIS _/
  
 -naturally, the categorical variables of field, auth & jour loc are being compared to the first level
 (will need to recode to compare to the mean- otherwise I don't think we can make meaningful interpretations) _/
 -should we also normalize some of these variables? _/
 
 
#### Plotting notes ####
 *summarizing data for OA vs Closed to make figures for:
   mean difference in total cite count with factors [JIF, field rank, # authors]
   heatmap of citations overlaying world map for location data _/ LSS
   
Update plots for simple model factors 
  - limit the use of violin plot
  - readability
  
Add code for interaction plot JY
