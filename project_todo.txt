#### General ####
 Update readme!

#### Data Wrangling/Clean UP ####
Things to export from original dataframe to fin dataframe (with index):
 year [45], author [2], reprint_address[24] _/
 
Things to edit for fin dataframe:
 impact factor quantiles _/
 author count _/
 origin of publication (corresponding author) _/ LSS
  This is add- but there are still some issues, example: Lanka = Sri Lanka _/ LSS
 exclude data that is from Zebrafish & published in 2019 _/ 
 
Things to manually add to metadata:
 GDP per country (classifying developing countries) ZP
 impact factor quantiles from WoS _PH
 impact factor _/ ACC/ZP
 *hybrid_convert _ TM
 grant/funding(research field ranking replaced this) _/ LSS
 journal country _/ SB
 publisher _/ ZP
 *Decide on minimum number of records per author country of origin
 
Filter by matching OA/CA in Volume_Issue _/ 
###### Statistical model notes #######
 add random variable of journal 
 add nesting factor for journal in research field
 
 to include as fixed effects in model testing: 
  pub year _/, # of authors _/, field!, impact factor _/, 
  publisher _/, *grant dollars(per field; PH?), 
  author country!, journal country!, 
  * mean/median h-index of associate prof per field
 -naturally, the categorical variables of field, auth & jour loc are being compared to the first level
 (will need to recode to compare to the mean- otherwise I don't think we can make meaningful interpretations)
 -should we also normalize some of these variables?
#### Plotting notes ####
 *summarizing data for OA vs Closed to make figures for:
   mean difference in total cite count with factors [JIF, field rank, # authors]
   heatmap of citations overlaying world map for location data _/ LSS
